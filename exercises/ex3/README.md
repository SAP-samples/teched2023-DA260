# Exercise 3 - Preparing Analytical Dataset with historic and delta records.
To create an analytical dataset model, you will need to create a graphical view model in the Data Builder. 
 So, let's get started then. These are the steps we are going to run through:
 
-	Exercise 3.1 - Create an Analytical Dataset model with transformation flow generated target delta table.
-	Exercise 3.2 – Update source tables record in Data Maintenance editor
-	Exercise 3.3 – Execute Transformation flow to pull the delta records from source.
-	Exercise 3.4 – Preview the Analytical dataset model to see the historical and latest pulled records from Transformation flow Delta local table

- ##	Exercise 3.1 - Create an Analytical Dataset model with transformation flow generated target delta table.
